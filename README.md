# UNI-T UT61E Python Library

Python library for reading data from UNI-T UT61E DMM.

## Update 12.2.2019. Added support to parse data you already have

If you have raw data from your UT61E using Arduino or some other ÂµP, check ut61e_parser_example.py file in src folder to see how it works.

## Overview

This library was written as a weekend project. Its main goal was to learn the UNI-T UT61E data protocol.

## Connecting to UT61E

The project uses the IR RS-232 adapter which is supplied with the DMM and Python ```pyserial``` library to read the data.

Serial port settings are 19200bps, 7 data bits, odd parity, 1 stop bit. The supplied adapter also requires DTR=1 and RTS=0.

## UNI-T UT61E protocol

The DMM uses Cyrustek ES51922 chipset which is also used in other digital multimeters. My main source of information about its protocol was the [UT61E data log in DMM.exe project by Henrik Haftmann](https://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~heha/hs/UNI-T/UT61E.LOG).

Cyrustek ES51922 chipset has more features than are implemented in this project. This program implements only the features used by UT61E.

Each data packet contains 14 bytes.

## Program structure, settings and output data format

### UT61E() class

Class constructor requires serial port name only. all other settings are defined by the following constants.

```BAUD_RATE```, ```BITS```, ```PARITY```, ```STOP_BITS```: serial port settings (always 19200, 7 bits, odd parity, 1 stop bit).

```TIMEOUT```: serial port read timeout.

```EOL```: footer bytes of valid data packet. Always 0x0D 0x0D (CR, LF or \r\n).

```RAW_DATA_LENGTH```: data packet size.

```READ_RETRIES```: packet reading attempts. This value shows how many attempts to receive a valid packet should be made before returning an error.

The ```UT61E``` class contains the following functions:

```read_raw_data(self)```: reads raw data packet from serial port as array of byte values.

```is_data_valid(self, raw_data)```: returns ```True``` if the received packet is valid.

```read_hex_str_data(self)```: returns string with hexadecimal byte values of the received packet.

```get_meas(self)```: parses the received packet and returns the data as dicitonary (explained later).

```normalize_val(self, val, units)```:  normalizes the measured value to standard units (voltage to Volt, current to Ampere, resistance to Ohm, capacity to Farad, frequency to Herz, other values are not changed).

```pretty_print(self, disp_norm_val = False)```: prints the received measurement in human readable form.

### Returned data format

The received data is returned by ```get_meas()``` function as a dictionary with the following fields:

```mode``` [string]: measurement mode,

```range``` [string]: measurement range,

```val``` [float]: displayed value,

```units``` [string]: displayed units,

```norm_val``` [float]: displayed value, normalized to standard units (Volt, Ampere, Ohm, Farad, Herz),

```norm_units``` [string]: units of normalized value,

```percent``` [boolean]: duty cycle (%) measurement,

```minus``` [boolean]: negative value is displayed,

```low_bat``` [boolean]: low battery indicator,

```ovl``` [boolean]: OL is displayed,

```delta``` [boolean]: relative measurement (delta),

```ul``` [boolean]: UL is displayed,

```max``` [boolean]: peak max value,

```min``` [boolean]: peak min value,

```dc``` [boolean]: DC voltage is measured,

```ac``` [boolean]: AC voltage is measured,

```auto``` [boolean]: auto range,

```hz``` [boolean]: frequency measurement,

```hold``` [boolean]: data hold active,

```data_valid``` [bool]: True if data in the dictionary is valid.

### ut61e_monitor.py

```PORT```: default serial port which will be used if it is not specified in command line.

```SLEEP_TIME```: time between reading measurements.

## Running the script

The ```ut61e_monitor.py``` script is run from command line using the following command:

```python ut61e_monitor.py [com_port_name]```

where ```[com_port_name]``` is the name of serial port where your IR receiver is connected. In Windows it will be ```COM1```, ```COM2``` or another COM port. In Linux the will usually be ```/dev/ttyUSB0```, ```/dev/ttyUSB1``` etc. If not specified, the script will use port name stored in ```PORT``` constant.
